Live site: https://social-network-clone.herokuapp.com/

For this project I created a clone of a typical social media site. Users can create an account, create posts, edit posts and like other user's posts. Each user has their own profile page that shows all the posts they've created. Users have the ability to follow other users so that the posts of the users they follow appear in their "following feed".
